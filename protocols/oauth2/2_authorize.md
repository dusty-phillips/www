# `/authorize` endpoint

The authorization endpoint triggers the authentication and authentication on provider side. Once the user is authenticated and has authorized access to the resources, it will be redirected back to the client "callback" URL.

If the user is already authenticated and has already granted permissions, the callback might be instantly called, resulting in SSO without user interaction.

### Mandatory Parameters

| Parameter      | Description                                                                                     |
